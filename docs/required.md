## **Necessary Items to be brought to College**

### **1. What Type of clothes should I pack?**

* Bangalore is moderately cold for major parts of the year and rains frequently, therefore it is adviced to keep the ratio of Winter:summer clothes higher.
* Pack light jackets, nothing heavy is necessary.
* Bangalore gets relatively hotter (30 Degrees) during the months of April-May, so plan accordingly.

### **2. Are sports Shoes necessary?**

* First year students have to attend P.E. 2 days in a week (as of 2018) as a compulsory course, so don't forget to bring sports shoes. The college would provide you a Nylon/Lycra tracksuit for both summers and winters.

### **3. Should I bring a scientific calculator?**

First year students would have most of their Exams on a Digital pad and calculator would be available on screen, so a calculator isn't a **necessity** in your 1st year. You could need it in your further years or certain courses.

You can also approach your seniors (who would be passing out) to buy theirs, as scientific calculators are rather expensive.

### **4. Should I bring a mattress Along?**

You can buy a mattress in campus on your first day, a shop would be set up where you can compare and buy whatever type of mattress you want.

### **5.  What all would be there in my room?**

* Table
* Chair
* Wardrobe
* Bed
* Storage cabinet
* Curtains
* Shoe Rack

### **6. What all should be brought from home? What can we buy at campus?**

Shops for the following items would be present on the first day, i.e. no need to get these from home:
* Mattresses
* Pillows
* Sanitary items - Buckets, Mugs


#### **There is a D-Mart outlet located approximately 1.5kms away from campus for purchasing necessary daily-use utilities, fruits/snacks and clothes.**

**The students don’t need to bring curtains and brooms, as
curtains will be already installed in your respective rooms and the
cleaning will be taken care of by the cleaning staff.**

## **Cell phone Connections**

There is an Airtel SIM card outlet near to the campus, students are
requested to get their SIM cards according to their preferences without
any worry of signal problems.

P.S. If you could bring some documents from home itself for getting your
accounts opened it would be easier since it could take the college
authorities some time to provide you with the necessary documents for
the same.

## **Banking Facilities / ATMs**

There is a SBI branch located in the close vicinity of the campus and
SBI, ICICI, HDFC, Indian Bank and AXIS Bank ATMs are located just outside the campus.
All students all advised to carry a set of necessary documents if you
want to open an account at the SBI branch. The institution or management
would not provide any further help in this matter.

## **Medicines**

There is no pharmacy inside the campus. An outlet of Apollo Pharmacy is
situated is very close to the campus (barely 200 - 300m), nevertheless if
any enrolled candidate has any medical condition, severe allergies or
any chronic ailment, it is advised to bring the medicines and prescriptions you might need
in an emergency.

#### **The management has made the facility of medical consultants available in campus six days in a week, further details will be made available to you once you complete your admission procedures.**
