##General FAQs

1. **I have received admission in IITs. Why should I consider joining
IIIT Bangalore?**

  No doubt, IIT's are the top-most institutes in the country and have been
  pioneers in higher education over the last few decades but IIIT Bangalore,
  since its inception, it has been considered one of the top institute for post-
  graduation, rated even above some IIT's

  The answer to your question is subjective, and depends on your point of
  view, your rank and your aim in life.

  If for instance you have a decent rank in JEE which guarantees you a
  decent branch in an old IIT, then by all means go for it. The trouble
  starts when you have a borderline rank. It then comes down
  to you, whether you want the IIT tag or the branch of your choice.

  We have once proven that IIIT Bangalore does not lag behind the IIT's. With the
  introduction to the iMTech course, we plan to do it again. The students
  here are extremely passionate about their course and many have even preferred
  joining IIIT Bangalore over the new IIT's. IIT's are considered superior to us and this
  drives us to put in an extra effort to show that we are second to none.

2. **Why should I join the 5-year dual degree programme? In the 4-year
programme, I finish one year early.**

  Firstly - the fact that it is an 'Integrated' course which helps you gain
  a year as opposed to typical BTech + MTech routes (5 yrs V 6 yrs). A seamless
  transition between undergraduate and master's courses allows for exposure
  to greater detail and greater breadth. And if you are keen to gain some specialization
  in your field by means of a Master's course, then why not choose an option that
  saves you an year?

  Also,everything depends on what you expect to achieve in terms of academic competence
  at the end of college. That depends upon how 'effective' a course will be. The iMTech
  course provides an opportunity for industry internship/thesis for the final part of the
  program - very valuable for work experience and developing research acumen. Also it is
  easy to plan a set of courses/electives for forthcoming years because they are
  being covered in the same institute (the knowledge requirements are better known).
  Consider finishing a fundamentals course in one institute and opting for the
  advanced course in a different one, it is hard to gauge the standards expected.

  Weigh 'your' options and plan well!!! That's the only true comparator.

3. **What have been the placements of students from IIIT Bangalore?**

    The fourth iMTech batch passed out in 2020 and these are the placement statistics.
    The packages for the iMTech 2020 batch were:

    **Max package : 43.31 LPA**

    **Average package : 24.88 LPA**

    **Median package : 23.84 LPA**

4. **I am not able to pay the fee. Is any financial assistance available?**

  Yes, financial assistance is available in the form of scholarships.

  Scholarship amounts vary from year to year depending on the available
  funding. The types are merit and need-based scholarships. The former is
  generally awarded to those with a high GPA (alternatively, those who are
  a part of the Dean's Merit List).

  Need based scholarship covers a larger part of the tuition fee and is
  designed to support those who require financial assistance. Typical
  amount of these scholarships is 20K-60K (per year).

5. **What is the criteria for scholarship at IIIT Bangalore and what costs does
    it cover?**

  Scholarship amounts vary from year to year depending on the available
  funding. The types are merit and need-based scholarships. The former is
  generally awarded to those with a high GPA (alternatively, those who are
  a part of the Dean's Merit List).

  designed to support those who require financial assistance. Typical
  amount of these scholarships is 20K-60K (per year).

6. **IIIT fee is higher than the fee at IITs or NITs. Why?**

    IIIT fees is higher than IITs and NITs since it is only partially funded
    by the government (PPP model) unlike the latter institutes, thus, it has
    to manage its own expenses. Also, with the current increment in the fees
    of IITs, their fees is nearly the same as that of IIIT Bangalore.

    Also, IIIT Bangalore provides much better facilities compared to most government
    colleges (single rooms, hot water etc.).
